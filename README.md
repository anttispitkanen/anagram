#Anagram
(Get it? Like Antti's Instagram? Super clever or what?)

This is my take on [Let's build Instagram from scratch with Ruby on Rails][] by Ben Walker, devwalks.com.
[Let's build Instagram from scratch with Ruby on Rails]: https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/

The app is (at least currently) running at [Heroku] (https://stormy-savannah-64012.herokuapp.com/), go check it out!

Tasks still to complete:
* fixing "show more comments" on index and explore (browse) on pages 2..n of paginator
* making the read/unread notifications stand out better
* adding notifications for received likes
* adding statistics to profiles
* adding the follow/following button to posts (not just profiles)
