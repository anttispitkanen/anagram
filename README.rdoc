This is my take on "Let's build Instagram from scratch with Ruby on Rails" by Ben Walker, devwalks.com.

Tasks still to complete:
-fixing "show more comments" on index and explore (browse) on pages 2..n of paginator
-making the read/unread notifications stand out better
-adding notifications for received likes
-adding statistics to profiles
-adding the follow/following button to posts (not just profiles)
